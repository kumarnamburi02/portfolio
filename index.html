    <section id="about">
        <h2 id="abt">About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Kumar Namburi, and I am a recent graduate of Kallam Haranadha Reddy Institute of Technology, Guntur, affiliated with Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Kakinada (JNTUK), where I majored in Computer Science and Engineering with a CGPA of 8.4.</p>

        <p>I have completed internships, including a Salesforce Developer Virtual Internship and a position at Microsoft. In addition to my academic pursuits, I served as an ambassador in the Career Guidance, Training, and Placement Cell at my college, helping my peers navigate their career paths.</p>
            
        <p>Possess strong technical skills in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. I also excel in communication and have a hardworking nature, making me a collaborative team player.</p>
            
        <p>Prior to my engineering degree, I completed my Intermediate at Sri Vyshnavi Junior College, Tenali (State Board) with a CGPA of 9.8, and my SSC at Abhyudaya High School, Gudlur (State Board) with a CGPA of 9.7.</p>

            <h3 id="stressdet">Stress Detection</h3>
            <p>The Stress Detection project aims to identify and analyze stress levels in individuals using various data inputs and algorithms. By gathering data through surveys and user inputs, I created a comprehensive dataset that served as the foundation for the analysis. I implemented machine learning algorithms to accurately classify stress levels based on factors such as emotional state, workload, and lifestyle choices. Additionally, I developed a user-friendly interface that allows users to input their data and receive feedback on their stress levels. The project also provides insights into stress patterns and offers recommendations for effective stress management. This experience not only enhanced my technical skills in programming and data analysis but also deepened my understanding of mental health and the importance of stress management.</p>
